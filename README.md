voteSafe1.py is my GUI information.
main.py is where I launch the application and where things are tied together at.
logic.py is where the code is written for the application.

VoteSafe is a more advanced version of Lab 1.  It asks the user to vote, either for candidate 1, candidate 2, or a write in candidate.
Then the user is asked to enter in there age, which has to be above or equal to 18 to vote.
Then the user is asked to enter in there voter ID, which has to be an ID that has not yet voted.
Then hit "Submit Vote" and the data is stored in a file called dataVoteSafe.csv in the format VoterID, Age, Vote.
